## Past Experience with This Community
This

#### **Response**:
> Example: "As a frequent user of Wikimedia projects like Wikipedia and Wiktionary, I’ve gained valuable insight into their open-source mission and functionality. Additionally, I've contributed to open-source initiatives within Wikimedia by [describe contributions, e.g., code, documentation, testing, etc.]. This involvement has helped me understand the community standards and the technical aspects related to translation tools and synonym resources."

## Outreachy Internship Project Timeline

### Week 1-2: Initial Setup and Familiarization
- **Task**: 
  - Get familiar with the Scribe community's codebase and Scribe-Data CLI structure.
  - Review Wiktionary and Wikidata resources and existing SPARQL queries.
  - Attend the initial bi-weekly sync to introduce yourself and discuss the project scope.
- **Goal**: 
  - Complete environment setup, understand data sources, and explore command-line architecture.
  - Collaborate with mentors to finalize objectives and clarify any technical requirements.

### Week 3-4: Development of Translation Functionality
- **Task**: 
  - Develop initial translation functionality for the Scribe-Data CLI to parse translations for a selected language from Wiktionary.
  - Write SPARQL queries with mentor support and focus on formatting data for Scribe end users.
  - Attend Saturday sync to present progress and gather feedback.
- **Goal**: 
  - Ensure data output is properly formatted for integration with Scribe applications (iOS/Android).
  - Draft initial unit tests to validate translation outputs.

### Week 5-6: Development of Synonym Functionality
- **Task**: 
  - Implement the synonym functionality in Scribe-Data, focusing on parsing and formatting synonym data from Wiktionary.
  - Write SPARQL queries to support synonym extraction and refine data outputs for downstream applications.
  - Gather feedback from mentors and the community in the bi-weekly sync.
- **Goal**: 
  - Synonym command should be functional and meet requirements for Scribe applications.
  - Continue expanding unit tests to cover edge cases and ensure reliable functionality.

### Week 7-8: Optimization and Efficiency Improvements
- **Task**: 
  - Optimize parsing processes for both translation and synonym commands to handle larger datasets efficiently.
  - Implement caching or other efficiency techniques to ensure smooth CLI performance.
  - Run performance tests to benchmark parsing speeds and review results with mentors.
- **Goal**: 
  - Improved performance for large Wiktionary dumps, minimizing memory usage and execution time.
  - Unit tests refined to cover performance metrics.

### Week 9: Advanced Testing and Validation
- **Task**: 
  - Complete comprehensive unit tests for all functionalities (translation and synonym commands).
  - Conduct regression testing to ensure previous changes don’t introduce breaking changes.
  - Review and validate tests with mentors.
- **Goal**: 
  - Ensure all commands are covered by tests to catch future breaking changes.
  - Test outputs formatted correctly for both CLI and end-user applications.

### Week 10: Documentation and Data Compliance
- **Task**: 
  - Write detailed documentation for both users and developers on using and extending the new CLI commands.
  - Collaborate with mentors to update data notices to ensure compliance with Wiktionary’s licensing.
- **Goal**: 
  - Complete documentation to facilitate future development and user adoption.
  - Ensure all data outputs comply with licensing requirements.

### Week 11: Final Improvements and Aspirational Goals
- **Task**: 
  - Make final adjustments and improvements based on testing feedback.
  - Explore any aspirational goals set with mentors (e.g., additional language support or advanced query features).
  - Attend the final bi-weekly sync to demonstrate a near-complete project.
- **Goal**: 
  - Ensure project is feature-complete with optional enhancements if feasible.
  - All functionality should be stable and ready for broader usage.
    
### Week 12: Project Wrap-Up and Presentation
- **Task**: 
  - Finalize all code, documentation, and tests.
  - Present the final project to the Scribe community, gathering feedback and suggestions.
  - Prepare a summary report for Outreachy, detailing project outcomes and any future recommendations.
- **Goal**: 
  - Successfully conclude the project with a completed and tested CLI for translations and synonyms.
  - Receive final approval from mentors and celebrate project completion with the community!
    
## Afterward of Internship

## About Me
I am Recently Graduated Student with Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering from G H Raisoni Insitute Of Engineering & Business Management, North Maharashtra University, Jalgaon. Since then i am on learning quest and upskilling my self to get full time job in information technology. I keen interest are into Python, Java, cloud technology, Devops, openSource contributions along side I am trying to learn ReactJS. 
I have participated and won some hackathons Hosted by MLH and continue to do so in free time, this help me learn and understand the implementation and learning of new things and integration while building.


## How did I learn about Outreachy?
Ecosystem over here is only about therotical learning and examination score! As the location of my education and college are in the city which is not so well technology aware, we can say most of the peoples here are Farmers, small scale business and factories. But the issue of staying in touch with latest tech updates and connection and sharing was smoothly solved with linkedin and internet. There over linkedin i got to know about most of opensource programs, after that i searched and viewed some videos over youtube regarding the same. I was not confident enough to apply and Self-doubt will i be able to do this. Then last time I applied for the initial application but it was rejected, but again this fall i applied and got main `you are selected as intern!` This was quite an experience and milestone for me!
