## Abstract
`Scribe-org` is an open source project which is a community of language enthusiasts, learners and developers creating tools to help people communicate with confidence.
It is an tool being developed for interested language learners with creative way, this is available for IOS ecosystem. The application provide an real time grammer, translations over keyboard which support to serval most used languages and its exanding too. The project Aim to breach the langauge barrier gap effectively by utilizing the data from wikidata by processing it.  
where as an subpart of project is `Scribe-Data` is a convenient command-line interface (CLI) for extracting and formatting language data from Wikidata and Wikipedia. Functionality includes allowing users to list, download, and manage language data directly from the terminal.

## Past Experience with This Community
I have benn working on Scribe-data project from pass few days and its quite interesting! Mentors are very friendly, guide when ever asked for help, listen to suggestions.
Also the contributors and quite friendly and share ideas with interacting each other. This is an first time i've gained such a experience with open source community project mission and objective. Working side to side with such fantastic contributors and maintainers i've been learning a lot. Before this i had never used an sparql query language but in this project while contributing i understand and contributed queries written in it, worked on some action flow to make task automate over repository.
Also worked on project documentation build using sphnix and learned about documentation and how its implemented for project like this one. Fix some error and build documentation to report broken link to maintainer/contributors.
This is just beginning there is more yet to learn and build! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

##  Experience and Contributions - INITIAL CONTRIBUTION
As applicatant selected for initail contribution, Have done some contibution in project code base as follows:
- 1. PR: https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/pull/425
- Detail: Added nouns sparql query for latvian langauge by quering against nouns entity on wikidata. Query have been tested and executed on Wikimedia query editor.

- 2. PR: https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/pull/272
- Detail: The issue was to expand the kurmanji verb entity by querying the wikidata language entity. To expand kurmanji verbs it has been queried against the other language entity for wikidata in sparql query language on wikidata query editor.

- 3. PR: https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/pull/317
- Detail: Created and expanded data queries for kurmanji language on query.wikidata.org query service by wikidata, where preposition, verbs, nouns, adverbs and adjective for kurmanji language 'ku' where queried against english language entity and entity entries for grammatical parts to get as much as possible data for language to be process by scribe data.

- 4. PR: https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/pull/433
- Detail: Created an Github action workflow to check documentation broken link and show broken link list for debugging and further work:
   1. Installs the necessary dependencies from requirements.txt
   2. Runs the Sphinx linkcheck builder to identify broken links.
   3. The results are displayed, and if broken links are found, the action will fail.

## Past Experience with Other Communities
I have also been involved in other free software communities such as Girlscript summer of code which is an open source program just pretty alike google summer of code, they have project mainntainers, contributors, mentors, and core team who carry out program of duration three month. the program is score based which reflect on leaderboard, score based on work done in contibution divided into 3 levels. I had participated as contributed and raised request which fixed documentation, code, and added some features. Along with this they had arranged postman badge challenege which was also compeleted resulting in extra points.

## How did I learn about Outreachy?
Ecosystem over here is only about therotical learning and examination score! As the location of my education and college are in the city which is not so well technology aware, we can say most of the peoples here are Farmers, small scale business and factories. But the issue of staying in touch with latest tech updates and connection and sharing was smoothly solved with linkedin and internet. There over linkedin i got to know about most of opensource programs, after that i searched and viewed some videos over youtube regarding the same. I was not confident enough to apply and Self-doubt will i be able to do this. Then last time I applied for the initial application but it was rejected, but again this fall i applied and got main `you are selected as intern!` This was quite an experience and milestone for me!
