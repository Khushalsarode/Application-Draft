## How did I learn about Outreachy?
Ecosystem over here is only about therotical learning and examination score! As the location of my education and college are in the city which is not so well technology aware, we can say most of the peoples here are Farmers, small scale business and factories. But the issue of staying in touch with latest tech updates and connection and sharing was smoothly solved with linkedin and internet. There over linkedin i got to know about most of opensource programs, after that i searched and viewed some videos over youtube regarding the same. I was not confident enough to apply and Self-doubt will i be able to do this. Then last time I applied for the initial application but it was rejected, but again this fall i applied and got main `you are selected as intern!` This was quite an experience and milestone for me!
